/**
 * Background atmosphere (M9.3 Home V3): the screen glow and Home's Nutrition band.
 *
 * PENDING BRAND REVIEW: these colors are not in the brand palette (packages/brand) yet and
 * IDENTIDAD.md does not cover background gradients; both are reviewed at M9 close (see
 * docs/mobile/m9-brand-polish-plan.md). Until then they live here, apart from the theme
 * color roles, which only map brand values. Dark mode keeps the brand dark palette; only
 * the glow and the band are new.
 *
 * `bandTextMuted` (grey over the light glow/band) and `accentStrong` (accent text on a light
 * accent-tinted glass button) exist only for contrast (≥ 4.5:1); dark uses the brand values.
 *
 * Colors are kept as "r,g,b" so every gradient stop uses the same color with its own alpha
 * (never "transparent", which interpolates through grey).
